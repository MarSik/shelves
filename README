Maven 3

Before build do the following:

git clone https://github.com/MarSik/jackson-databind.git

pushd jackson-databind
git checkout improve-unresolved-handling-2.6
mvn clean install
popd

git clone https://github.com/pauloubuntu/identicon.git
pushd identicon
mvn clean install
popd

Building:

Just type "mvn clean install" to generate all necessary files.

=== deploy ===

There are two files that contain all that is needed for deploy.

services/web/target/web-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war
services/backend/target/backend-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war

You can extract the files from web.war and serve them using any simple http
server like nginx. You can find the example configuration in doc/nginx.

The backend.war file is an executable Java archive and the example startup
script is located in doc/deploy. The script is designed to use an exploded
war (unzip the .war file somewhere and set the DEPLOY variable in the run
script accordingly).
